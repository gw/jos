## Part A

> Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. Bearing in mind that kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE just like everything else in the kernel, what is the purpose of macro MPBOOTPHYS? Why is it necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in boot/boot.S? In other words, what could go wrong if it were omitted in kern/mpentry.S?

boot.S doesn't need it because BIOSes always load it at `0x7c00` AND it's linked at `0x7c00`:
```shell
$ objdump -h obj/boot/boot.out
obj/boot/boot.out:     file format elf32-i386

```
Also see: `boot/Makefrag`.

Thus, no relocations are required b/c boot.S runs from the same physical memory into which it is initially loaded.

However, `mpentry.S` is compiled into the *kernel* image--thus, it is *loaded* at `0x100000` (physical) but *runs* from `0xf0100000` (virtual). It's common for OS kernels to run from high addresses like that b/c it leaves the bottom portion of virtual memory free for user procs. However, the machine might not have that much physical memory, so the kernel gets loaded at 1mb in physmem, just above BIOS ROM, hence the indirection. (see [Lab 1](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/labs/lab1/)).

This means that the linker binds address references in `mpentry.S` to high addresses relative to `0xf0100000` just like everything else in the kernel image. This would be fine once paging is enabled, but `mpentry.S` *is* the code that sets up paging for APs. Indeed, APs start in real mode, and thus can only run code below 640kb (in Low Memory).

This means we have to copy the `mpentry.S` code to `MPENTRY_PADDR` (0x7000), but any unused page-aligned physical address below 640kb would work. Thus, its "load address" is `MPENTRY_PADDR`, but it's link address remains unchanged from when the kernel image was linked: `0xf0100000`. This means we have to do some manual relocation--we achieve this with the `MPBOOTPHYS` macro which simply re-calculates absolute memory references in `mpentry.S` to be based off `MPENTRY_PADDR` instead of `0xf0100000`.

We could maybe achieve the same effect by putting `mpentry.S` in a different section of the kernel image so we can give it a different link address.


>It seems that using the big kernel lock guarantees that only one CPU can run the kernel code at a time. Why do we still need separate kernel stacks for each CPU? Describe a scenario in which using a shared kernel stack will go wrong, even with the protection of the big kernel lock.

Even if one kernel thread holds the lock it can still be interrupted. When that happens, the x86 hardware pushes a trapframe onto whatever kernel stack is in the TSS. If we only had one big kernel stack shared b/w all CPUs, then if one thread is in the kernel, other threads could be simultaneously pushing trap frames onto the stack and clobbering it.

>In your implementation of env_run() you should have called lcr3(). Before and after the call to lcr3(), your code makes references (at least it should) to the variable e, the argument to env_run. Upon loading the %cr3 register, the addressing context used by the MMU is instantly changed. But a virtual address (namely e) has meaning relative to a given address context--the address context specifies the physical address to which the virtual address maps. Why can the pointer e be dereferenced both before and after the addressing switch?

Because the JOS kernel maps its own VM mappings (linear->physical mappings for high-address kernel code) into the address space of EVERY newly allocated environment. Thus, switching to a new env's page dir won't change how kernel variables are mapped.

>Whenever the kernel switches from one environment to another, it must ensure the old environment's registers are saved so they can be restored properly later. Why? Where does this happen?

It's gotta save execution thread state (register state, stack) so the environment can be re-run later. JOS gets some help from the x86 hardware, which pushes register state into the trapframe on the kernel stack on every trap before giving control to the kernel. In `trap()`, `curenv->env_tf = *tf;` takes this kernel stack state and saves it on the Env struct.
